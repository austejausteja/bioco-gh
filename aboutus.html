        <h2> Our Story </h2>
        <p> BioBlog is a platform for all science lovers to share their work in the form of blog posts.
          <br>Submissions can range from lab reports, review papers, portfolios etc.
          <br> Our main goal is to create a space where many STEM subjects can be discussed,
          constructively criticised and shared among fellow scientist peers.
          <br> If you are interested in submitting an article, <a href="contactus.html"> CLICK HERE</a>.

        <h5> Austeja </h5>
        <p>Hi! I am Austeja, a 2nd Year MSci Biomedical Science student at the University of Sussex.
         I am very passionate about education, particularly education in science, so creating a platform where we
       are able to contribute our best work and learn from each other has been such a fulfilling experience.
     In a couple of years I hope to be doing research, perhaps on neurodegenerative disease, and still delving into many educational practices!</p>
