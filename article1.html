Introduction
<br>
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prominent neurodegenerative disorder, becoming more prevalent with older age yet the aetiology of Parkinson’s is still unknown (Lesage and Brice, 2009; Kalia and Lang, 2015). Research has established that PD causes the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantial nigra in the brainstem (Alam and Schmidt 2002). This results to well-known symptoms associated to PD such as a resting tremor, rigidity of the joints and overall motor dysfunctions. These symptoms only become obvious when 50-70% of the dopaminergic neurons are already lost, hence it is important to study the origins of Parkinson’s to reduce the occurrence before it’s too late (Lesage and Brice, 2009).
A theory introduced by neuroanatomist Braak discusses the cause of PD originating from prions, protein aggregates caused by misfolding proteins at the brainstem and spreading to more neurons upwards to eventually affect the dopaminergic neurons (Braak et al., 2003. Figure 1).
Besides prions, there are many other suggestive causes of PD, all linking to the dysfunction of dopamine and causing parkinsonian-like symptoms.
<br>
<br>
Aims
<br>
To discuss research focusing on causes of Parkinson’s disease and evidence that different causes lead to neuronal degeneration. The present paper aims to argue that prions are not the leading cause of PD and that other contributing factors are more likely to contribute.
<br>
<br>
Aetiology: Prions
<br>
The gene PRNP encodes for the prion proteins (PrPC) which are not all negatively associated to spreading their misfolded structure onto other proteins. PrPC exist endogenously in cell membranes of multiple tissues in the body and are perceived as harmless. The isoform of PrPC is PrPS, which contain the infectious properties causing most prion-like diseases. PrPS are able to convert PrPC by changing its structure through different mechanisms, such as a sporadic change, genetic mutations of PRNP or ingested pathogens (Hilker et al., 2011). Alpha- synuclein (α-synuclein) is the main component of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN), that can also be found in other neurodegenerative disorders. Alpha-synuclein is thought to be the targeted protein responsible for PD (Breydo et al.,2012)
The prion-like hypothesis suggests an ascending pathway mechanism of prions from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to central nervous system (CNS). An unknown pathogen ingested into the gut would spread mainly through the vagus nerve and olfactory tract until it reaches the CNS (Rietdijk et al., 2017).</p2>
<br>
In their method, they collected samples of brains from 3 different cases.
<br> •	Group 1 consisted of 41 autopsy brains from patients who were clinically diagnosed with PD and had associated symptoms.
<br> •	Group 2 were also autopsied brains from 69 individuals who had no clinically linked symptoms of PD.
<br> •	Group 3 were used for comparison and consisted of 58 subjects matched by age and gender, with no recorded medical history of neurological or psychiatric disease.
<br>
When analysed, the brain tissues from group 1 showed presence of LB and a severe loss of neurons. Group 2, all 69 subject samples also showed evidence of LN and/or LB. However, group 3 had no cases of LB or LN in the same areas. They were able to conclude that there was a correlation between the presence of α-synuclein infiltrated Lewy bodies and clinically diagnosed PD patients (Braak et al., 2003). Other studies also supported this theory as Lewy bodies were seen in neurons of transplanted midbrains, meaning α-synuclein proteins target nearby neurons to continue spreading (Sung et al., 2005).
<br>
<br>
Aetiology: The Threshold Theory
<br>
Studies suggested that 47% of the cases looking into Lewy pathology didn’t follow the ascending theory, and a number of brains from PD patients showed no signs of α-synuclein pathology in the key areas such as the vagus nucleus (Kalaitzakis et al., 2008). Therefore, Braak’s theory is not effective in all cases of PD.
A new theory suggests that there is a degeneration of the PNS and CNS simultaneously. Alpha-synuclein is not just targeted at the areas of the substantial nigra and brainstem, but in many other body tissues. Each system has a different threshold to symptoms; therefore, explains why PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Motor symptoms associated to PD become apparent when 70% of dopaminergic neurons are degraded thus, the threshold for the midbrain is higher. However, functional threshold for peripheral systems is lower, explaining the nonmotor symptoms reported earlier in the patient’s life (Engelender and Isacson, 2017).
<br>
The threshold theory therefore argues against Braak’s prion theory that PD, is primarily caused by a spread of α-synuclein in an ascending pathway. It is not prions that trigger and infect surrounding neurons, but all cells are affected at the same time. Each system just has different thresholds to how much toxicity they can handle, before symptoms occur. Overall, more research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of α-synuclein accumulation.
<br>
<br>
Other leading factors
<br> •	Environmental factors are widely studied as many aspects in everyday life have been suggested to be a contributing factor of developing PD. Some examples include badly packaged meats, general old age, pesticides, gut substances, oxidative stress, vitamin D deprivation, etc (Kalia and Lang, 2015).
<br> •	Genetics may also be heavily influential as most cases of PD are recorded in Caucasians and Hispanics compared to Afro-Americans and Asians (Rietdijk et al., 2017). Genetic mutations in the Parkin gene is a heritable trait, that can cause early on-set cases of PD that defies the ascending prions theory.
<br>
<br>
Conclusion
<br>
Braak’s hypothesis is partially based on the cause of an unknown pathogen, therefore more research is needed to understand the exact pathogen, if true, and target how to eliminate this. Although, there are multiple evidence to suggest that Parkinson’s disease is caused by a prion-like disorder, most of the hypothesis does not apply to all PD patients. Braak’s idea opened up extensive research into understanding prions, but these mainly focus on progressive PD patients. This would conclude that there is an environmental factor that plays a larger role in patients who develop PD later in their lives. In comparison, early on-set PD is due to genetics, where there are no signs of α-synuclein accumulation in the brain (Valente et al., 2004). The threshold theory provides a new insight at explaining the pathology of PD and how there are many other contributing factors. Parkinson’s should be considered a syndrome with both internal and external causes in order to help prevent future cases.
