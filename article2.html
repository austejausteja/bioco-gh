A) Introduction
<br>Investigating the taxonomic relationships between different habitats is essential to a scientific
understanding of both animals and the environments they live in. To make comparisons, it is
necessary to collect relevant data. It is difficult to accurately monitor the biodiversity of a large
habitat, especially as many land arthropods can be small, camouflaged, and difficult to find. A
population sample can be estimated using pitfall traps. These simple traps are ground level and will
catch any arthropods walking over them, allowing the organisms to be collected and studied further.
<br>As stated by Brown and Matthews, “loss of biodiversity is a global issue, necessitating investigation
at multiple spatial and temporal scales” (Brown and Matthews, 2016, p.3953) This highlights the
importance of studies in uncovering ecological relationships. This paper also mentions pitfall
trapping as a way to quantify activity of animals as well as their density (Brown and Matthews,
2016).
<br>This study investigates the species richness between woodland and plantation habitats. This
involves performing a statistical test to see whether there is a significant difference between number
of individuals for each species in each habitat. These two environments differ in their physical and
vegetative makeups, leading to the assumption that there will be a statistical difference in species
diversity.
<br>
<br>B) Methods
<br>1. Site
<br>The fieldwork was conducted in the vegetative area behind the University of Sussex library. In this
site both woodland and plantation type habitats were located, necessary for the investigation.
<br>
2. Sampling
<br>Pitfall trapping was used to collect the data. Holes were dug into the ground and plastic pint cups
were placed into the ground so that the opening of the cup was level with the ground. Ethanol was
put into the bottom of the cup to kill the arthropods and prevent predation. Each group put three
cups at each site and marked them with a tag. The traps were collected after five days. The collected
organisms were immediately taken to the lab for identification.
<br>
3. Statistics
<br>The number of individuals per species for each sample was added up so that species diversity could
be tested.
<br> The data was tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test, where the sig. value can be
compared to a standard level of significance of 0.05. This calculated whether the data was normally
distributed.
<br> To test whether there was a significant difference between number of individuals in species
between habitats, i.e. species diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed. The null hypothesis
states that the species distributions are equal, a P-value comparison will reject or accept this
hypothesis.
<br>
<br>
C) Results
<br>Shapiro-Wilk was performed to test the normality of the data. For woodlands, the sig. level came
out to be 0.000037, as this is less than 0.05, the data is shown to be not normally distributed for
woodlands. For plantation, the sig. level came out to be 0.000036. The data is also not normally
distributed for plantation (see figure 1 for data).
<br>A Mann-Whitney U test was performed with the independent, nonparametric data sets. Results of
the test shown below. The P-value came out to be 0.379, as this is greater than 0.05, there is a
failure to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant difference in individuals per
species between the two groups. This points to little species diversity between woodlands and
plantations.
<br>
<br>
D) Discussion
<br>1. Summary
<br>This pitfall trap study led to a discovery that there was no significant difference between the
amounts of individuals for each species between woodland and plantation habitats. This outcome
suggests that the ecological differences between the two habitats are minimal. Twenty-five species
of arthropods were identified during the study, and numbers of individuals in each species were
similar between the two groups. The conclusion that can be drawn is that the two areas house
similar amounts of individuals, and also similar diversity in species. This leads to the assumption
that shelter, food sources, predation, climate, and other living factors must be analogous. Due to
there being no significant difference, it is possible that there is movement/migration between the
two ecosystems.
<br>2. Validity
<br>Data could have been improved by spreading traps over a larger area to assess a greater habitat area.
Leaves and rainwater were removed from traps, some small arthropods could have been lost in the
removal process, i.e. ones that were small or stuck to leaves. Errors in identification of organism
species were also possible, leading to anomalies. Performing additional statistical tests would
further assess the differences between the environments. E.g. species richness, where total number
of individuals for each habitat is compared.
<br>3. Implications
<br>Pitfall trapping provides insight into arthropod ecosystems, relevant in conservational biology.
Statistical testing is necessary in assessing biodiversity loss and the taxonomic welfare. However, as
stated in Brown and Matthew’s study there, “exist significant difficulties in the analysis of longterm
and spatially large data, especially where the methodology between researchers differs”
(Brown and Matthews, 2016, p.3953). A call for a more united approach in statistical testing of the
ecological sort is necessary.
<br>Pitfall trapping can be an indicator of ecosystem nature, yet iterated in a study by Engel et al, this
type of trap can be biased due to varied locomotive abilities of arthropods (Engel et al., 2017).
However, another study compared pitfall trapping to quadrat testing and found that pitfalls were
more successful in estimating taxonomic richness, suggesting pitfall traps are satisfactory in this
field (Corti, Larned and Datry, 2013).
<br>In a study similar to this portfolio, pitfall trapping was used and species richness was found to be
extremely variable between country grain and local grain in European countries (Entling et al.,
2012). However, in comparing the two, Entling et al collected data on an extremely large scale and
environment types were far more variable, further stressing the irregularity in studies of this kind.
With communication between researchers of this field, ecological biodiversity loss can be tackled
as an issue, and relationships between habitats and their ecosystems can be successfully unveiled.
