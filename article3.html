a.)Is going BPA-free the answer?
        <hr>

Bisphenol A is an oestrogen mimic found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Threats of BPA to the mammalian reproductive system was first found out due to an accidental exposure of caged female mice in 1998. This exposure, caused their oocytes to exhibit high levels of defects in the chromosome alignment in the first meiotic spindle, termed as congressional failure (Patricia A. Hunt et al, 2003). The study then showed how a short term low dosage of BPA was sufficient to cause congressional failure, which then would lead to aneuploidy. In a later study carried out to investigate on the effects of BPA on gametes, it was found that BPA exposure causes failure in the normal chromosome movement in prophase. It also showed that BPA acts as an oestrogen antagonist as it mimics a non functioning receptor mutation (Susiarjo M. et al, 2007).
As the above investigations mostly concerns over female oocytes, other experiments have been carried out to study the effect BPA in male mice during neonatal development. It was seen that unlike in female oocytes chromosome pairing and synapsis was undisturbed. Whilst determining whether the effect of oestrogen was due to changes to the germline or stoma of testis, it was concluded that exogenous oestrogenic exposure causes changes to the stem cell pool and hence permanent alteration in spermatogenesis (Vrooman L.A. et al, 2015).
Due to the findings that BPA was a harmful biocontaminant, many countries have legislations banning BPA products. However BPA-free products are not less harmful than BPA, they are already classified as biocontaminants although further studies have to be carried out on them. BPA was taken for granted at first as it was assumed it was a weak oestrogen mimic based on its binding affinity but later on we find out its adverse effects on mammalian reproduction and how it can be both oestrogenic and  an antioestrogen mimic. Similarly it is seen that other bisphenol products pose similar threats, for example BPS and BPF (Sartain CV and Hunt PA 2016). Although experimental data is still insufficient, further investigations should be carried out, so that we are not exposed to harmful contaminants.

b.)Why are we going BPA-free?

In the past few years BPA has become an increasing concern to our health. BPA, which stands for Bisphenol A is found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. These are mostly used as food containers, water bottles and coatings on food tins. It is found to be an oestrogen mimic compound and it’s health risks were discovered only recently due to an accidental BPA exposure to a control mice colony (Patricia A. Hunt et al, 2003).
In 1998 during an experiment carried out to study meiotic failures in mice oocytes (immature egg cells found in their ovaries), the control mice colony was accidentally exposed to BPA that was present in the detergent used to clean their cages. This exposure caused a drastic increase in meiotic failures, such as failure in alignment of chromosomes in meiosis. Researchers then had to prove that the cause of this was BPA. Therefore they re-designed an experiment so that the accidental exposure was simulated and proved that a short-term, low-dosage of BPA was enough to cause these problems. Meiotic failure causes aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes) which is the main cause of miscarriages and mental retardation and congenital defects. Hence BPA can be a huge threat.
Later an investigation was carried out to further study how BPA affects the genetic quality of gametes (Susiarjo M. et al, 2007). This study explains how meiotic failure occurs in mice oocytes (as mentioned above). It involves in exposing the individual using BPA pellets, and then examining ovaries at prophase. This showed how BPA affected chromosome movement and attachment in chiasmata and caused problems in crossing over, which further proved that it cause aneuploidy. In addition the previous study mentioned above, it shows how BPA can turn out to be an antagonist to oestrogen as it mimics a mutation. Hence why BPA is being used less now in the industry.
