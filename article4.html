<br>DNA Helicases are a large and widespread type of enzymes that utilise the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to unwind short stretches of annealed double strand DNA into its single-strand components, just ahead of the replication fork (Berg et al., 2015). Helicases play a role in many biological processes, including DNA replication, recombination, repair and transcription, in part due to their directionality, i.e. their ability to move either 5’ to 3’ or 3’ to 5’ along the DNA (Croteau et al., 2014).
<br>Humans possess a RecQ family of DNA helicases, which contains five helicases: RECQL1, BLM, WRN, RECQL4 and RECQL5 (also known as RecQ5). RecQ5 is an ATP-dependent 3’ to 5’ DNA helicase and shares some structural similarities with the other RecQ members through highly conserved protein domains (i.e. core helicase domain HD1+HD2). The unique protein motifs give the enzyme its distinctive functions that contribute to genome stability (Croteau et al., 2014).
<br>
<br> In base excision repair, RecQ5-depleted cells accumulate oxidative DNA damage, in part due to the enzyme’s regulation and hyper-activation of PARP1, which introduces ADP-ribose moieties to chromatin-binding proteins, thus affecting chromatin function. This would indicate that RecQ5 stops activation of PARP1 responding to oxidative DNA damage.
RecQ5 is able to bind to both initiating and elongating forms of RNA polymerase II in order to inhibit transcription. In terms of DNA replication, RecQ5 promotes strand exchange on synthetic stalled replication fork-like structures, thus a link can be established with transcription inhibition, where replication fork collapse can be avoided because of head-on collision between both transcription and replication machineries.
While DNA replication is occurring, two DNA strands are linked due to recombination, and need to be untangled by decatenation. RecQ5 is able to physically interact with Topoisomerase Iiα and stimulate this decatenation activity. When RecQ5 is not present, cell proliferation is inhibited, which consequently induces the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle.
RecQ5 stimulates WRN, which induces cooperativity of the two helicases during repair and restart of synthetic stalled replication fork-like structures. Synthetic lethality comes about when both helicases are defective (Croteau et al., 2014).
<br>
<br>
RecQ5 acts as a suppressor of homologous recombination (HR), a mechanism of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. It accumulates at DSB sites and physically interacts with RAD51, disrupting the binding of a RAD51 presynaptic filament to single-strand DNA (a crucial HR process). RecQ5 physically interacts with RAD51 in a single 70 amino acid (654-725) domain in non-conserved C-terminal, with an essential phenylalanine 666, leading to an ATP hydrolysis-dependent disruption of RAD51 filaments. When mutations are introduced, RecQ5 isn’t able to inhibit HB-mediated DSB repair. Furthermore, when wild type RecQ5 is overexpressed, HB is significantly supressed. All this points to RecQ5's suppressive role in HR through RAD51 filament disruption (Schwendener et al. 2010).
